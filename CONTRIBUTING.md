## Bugs and Feature Requests

Before creating an issue, [check the backlog](https://dev.azure.com/dwrdev/projector/_backlogs/backlog/Projector%20Maintainers/Backlog%20items)
to see if there is already a bug or feature request that matches your own. If not, add a new one.

## Documentation

The [documentation for all `pjr` commands](docs/commands.md) is auto-generated from the description and options specified in the source code.
Please see [the corresponding section in our developer docs](docs/DEVELOPER.md#command-documentation) for more info.

All other documentation is maintained in Markdown files and should be considered living documents.

## Developer Docs

Please see our [developer docs](docs/DEVELOPER.md) for more information on contributing source code to the project.

## Code Reviews

We welcome code reviews from anyone, even those without contributor access.
Each pull request will need at least one approval from one of the maintainers.
